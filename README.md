## Description

**Distributor In Background** add-on is for extending the Distributor plug-in (see [DistributorPlugin.com](https://distributorplugin.com)) 
functionality to handle actions via cron job in background. Recommended to use in combination with [WP Task Manager](https://github.com/NovemBit/wp-task-manager/tree/develop) plug-in 
 to maintain more control over the scheduled tasks, otherwise tasks will be scheduled via Wordpress cron.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6+
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 4.7+
* Distributor plug-in (recommended with [Distributor fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor))

## Install

At the moment, **Distributor In Background** add-on is not yet compatible with the original [Distributor] plug-in 
(https://github.com/10up/distributor), therefore, please use our  [Distributor fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor).

Once you have Distributor installed, [download the latest master build](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor-in-background) 
and install on your website.

## Plugin Usage

You just need to have **Distributor In Background** add-on installed on the "source", no additional configuration required. 
Please note that this add-on was tested for single-site installation with external connections.
